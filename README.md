# The kinematics evaluation of galaxies by using the Convolutional Neural Network

In this study, we leverage CNNs to classify galaxies as slow or fast rotators based on their stellar kinematics maps. We adopt a supervised learning approach, utilizing labeled data from the SAMI catalog as our training, testing, and validation datasets. Through this process, we aim to identify the optimal CNN architecture, achieving an accuracy of approximately 91 % on the test set. Subsequently, we apply our trained model to classify previously unknown rotators galaxies for which traditional statistical tools have been unable to determine whether they exhibit fast or slow rotation. Our findings reveal that the CNN model provides reasonable predictions on the side of visual inspection of these classifications. Ultimately, this work highlights the effectiveness of CNNs in distinguishing between slow and fast rotators, demonstrating their potential to advance our understanding.
